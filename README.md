# Ray Thomas Portfolio

## Description

This website is the future website of my work to come. It currently has placeholder files where my future projects will go but it currently functions as my portfolio. This portfolio will be used to showcase my skills and accomplishments to future employers. It shows my understanding of HTML and CSS, as well as an eye for minimal design and keeping the content front and center for the employer to easily access it.

## Installation

The website is accessed through this link to the GitHub Pages created for it. 
https://raythomass.github.io/raythomas-portfolio/

## Usage

This website does not require any uasage instructions. This website functions the same as a landing page. All the links are clickable however not all of them have permanent places to link to. The destination of certain links will be added in the future once there is a destination to add.
